## How to Play Farkle
These rules are the most commonly used rules, though there are other variations out there.

One player is chosen to begin and turns move clockwise around the table.

Each player, in turn, rolls all six dice and checks to see if they have rolled any scoring dice or combinations.
(**See _Scoring_ below**) Any dice that score may be set aside and then the player may choose to roll all the
remaining dice. The player must set aside at least one scoring die of their choice if possible, but it is not required
to set aside all scoring dice.

>For example, if a player rolled 1-2-2-5-5-6 on their turn, they could set aside the 1 and the two 5's for scoring, or
they could choose to set aside only the 1.

Any scoring dice that are not set aside may be rerolled along with the other non-scoring dice.

If all six dice have been set aside for scoring, the player can choose to roll all six dice again and continue adding
to their accumulated score, or they can bank their points, end their turn, and pass the dice to the next player.

If a player scores no points on a roll, this is known as a Farkle. The player may continue to roll any dice that have
not been previously set aside for scoring, but all of their points gained thus far are lost.

At the end of a player's turn, any points they have scored are written down and the dice are passed to the next player.

## FARKLE SCORING
- **1**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;100 points
- **5**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;50 points
- **Three 1's**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1,000 points
- **Three 2's**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;200 points
- **Three 3's**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;300 points
- **Three 4's**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;400 points
- **Three 5's**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;500 points
- **Three 6's**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;600 points
- **1-2-3-4-5-6**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;3,000 points
- **3 Pairs**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1,500 points (Including 4-of-a-kind and a pair)

Note that scoring combinations only count when made with a single throw. (Example: If a player rolls a 1 and sets it
aside and then rolls two 1's on their next throw, they only score 300 points, not 1,000.)

Sometimes a single roll will provide multiple ways to score. For example, a player rolling 1-2-3-5-5-5 could score
one of the following:
- 100 points for the 1
- 150 points for the 1 and a 5
- 500 points for the three 5's
- 600 points for the 1 and the three 5's

## WINNING FARKLE
The first player to score a total of 10,000 or more points wins, provided that no other players with a remaining turn
can exceed that score.
